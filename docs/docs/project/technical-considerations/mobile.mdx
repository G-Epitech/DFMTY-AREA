# Mobile Development Technologies

Mobile development technologies are essential for creating the frontend layer of Triggo. The goal is to deliver native applications, including a web application and a cross-platform mobile application (compatible with both Android and iOS).

### Swift & Kotlin

The two best technologies for mobile development are **Swift** and **Kotlin**, as they provide native functionalities for both Android and iOS platforms. These languages are highly performant and widely used in the industry.

However, Swift, the language used for iOS development, can only be utilized on macOS, which presents a challenge for our team. With a team of five members, assigning two developers to two separate applications could also introduce time constraints.

### Flutter

Flutter, a framework for "cross-platform" mobile development, allows developers to create a single codebase compatible with both Android and iOS. This makes Flutter an ideal choice for projects with small teams.

Flutter's highly active community, Googleâ€™s support, strong performance, ease of learning, and some team membersâ€™ prior experience with the framework made it an obvious choice for this project.
