# Frontend Layer of Triggo

The frontend layer of Triggo will be divided into two parts, both offering the same features. The goal is to deliver native applications, including a web application and a cross-platform mobile application (compatible with both Android and iOS). 

As with the backend layer, the technologies compared in this document will be filtered to those known/learned by the team members.

### React

</div>

React is by far the most used and popular framework for the web frontend layer, with 41% of web developers using it today. Open-source and backed by Meta, React stands out due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity of development, providing an excellent developer experience.

One of React's advantages is the freedom it offers, allowing developers to implement complex logic as they see fit. However, this permissiveness can lead to bugs and make the codebase inconsistent due to varying practices.

While React's simplicity is a strength, it also means fewer built-in features compared to other frameworks. Developers often rely on external libraries to achieve their goals. Thanks to React's highly active community, this is generally possible, but it can lead to significant complications, especially if one of these libraries is no longer maintained. A large number of external dependencies is rarely ideal.

### Vue.js

VueJS is a relatively young framework, with 8 years of existence, but it has quickly become popular in the web development community for obvious reasons. Its exceptional tooling, efficiency, active community, and ease of learning make VueJS an excellent choice for web development.

That said, VueJS's youth is also its weakness. With less support from major tech players like Google or Meta, its development team remains relatively small and less financially backed. This is evident in its stability, which is not yet on par with React or Angular, making VueJS less suitable for large-scale projects.

### Angular

Angular is a highly mature, open-source framework supported by Google. It is frequently used for enterprise applications due to its scalability. Currently in its 19th version, Angular natively provides numerous tools to enhance the developer experience and code quality.

These tools also introduce a more complex and opinionated code structure compared to other frontend frameworks. This necessitates greater effort in structuring code and results in increased verbosity. Consequently, Angular is better suited for long-term stability and maintainability rather than rapid development.

As mentioned earlier, Angular's tooling is excellent. Its CLI simplifies project setup and configuration, while debugging tools and performance optimization features like AoT (Ahead-of-Time compiler) and change detection improve the development process. Angular also benefits from an active community and detailed documentation, which facilitate learning and sharing best practices among developers.

In conclusion, Angular excels at building complex, maintainable, and scalable applications. While it requires a significant initial investment to master its concepts and structure, this effort is well worth it for the stability and reliability it provides in the long term.

Angular's development philosophy aligns perfectly with that of .NET. Both are mature frameworks that allow for extensive scalability and have proven their reliability over decades. This synergy resonates strongly with our team's mindset and ensures the quality of our project.
