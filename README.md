## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Development Version
For the development version, you do not need to build the mobile application as it takes a significant amount of time. Simply run:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Or, if the images are already built:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Production Version
In the production environment, you must build the mobile application. To include the mobile build, you have to use the profile production in the docker-compose command:

```
docker-compose --profile production up --build
```
