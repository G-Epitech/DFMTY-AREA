## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Development Version
For the development version, you do not need to build the mobile application as it takes a significant amount of time. Simply run:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Or, if the images are already built:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Production Version
In the production environment, you must build the mobile application. To include the mobile build, set the `BUILD_MOBILE` environment variable before running the commands:

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
$env:BUILD_MOBILE="true"
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Linux/macOS
```sh
export BUILD_MOBILE=true
docker-compose up --build
```
